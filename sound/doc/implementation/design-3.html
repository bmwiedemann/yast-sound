<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Related system configuration files</A></H2>

<P>Just this two files are accessed directly. Some other files
(<CODE>/etc/asound.conf</CODE>) are accessed indirectly by calling
external programs (<CODE>alsactl</CODE>).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 /etc/modules.conf</A>
</H2>

<P>This file is used for <I>reading/writing</I>. Currently reading is used
just for removing previously made entry for the sound (ALSA)
modules. Writing add to the end of the file sound card configuration,
so the start (<CODE>/etc/rc.d/alsasound</CODE>) script can be used to
start sound. 
<P>
<P>Thi file is accessed by anyagent (which is implemented in this module)
and reads/writes line by line whole file. Some better agent should be
used in the future.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 /proc/asound/cards</A>
</H2>

<P>This file is used for <I>reading</I> and is parsed just to test the
sound card configuration. There is anyagent in the SCR path
(``.proc.asound.cards'') that reads this file.
